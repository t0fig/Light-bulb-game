                <p>Once upon a time, King Unnamed of Nowhereland was both smiling and crying at the same time. He was
                    smiling because his enormous brand-new palace with many spacious rooms and corridors has just been
                    finished. He is also crying as these rooms need to be illuminated and kept warm, but the ongoing
                    increase of utility costs affect him as well. So now it's time to think about the placement of the
                    palace's light bulbs. You need to place them so that everything is properly lit, but we cannot
                    install
                    any unnecessary bulbs.<s> In case of failure you, probably, will be executed.</s></p>
